Aionic offers open source applications for project management and collaboration. Our focus is on simplifying and accelerating the workflow for agile teams in the open source way.

## Description

Aionic offers a set of **open source products** for project management of any size. All our products are released under the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license, so feel free to customize it and share it with others!

Please keep in mind that we just develop the software and don't host the applications anywhere for public usage. That means you have to take care of the hosting for yourself.

All products are built on top of the **Aionic Core** application, since this is the place where all your data is managed and distributed. So for the usage of any other application, you have to use at least [Aionice Core](https://github.com/Aionic-Apps/aionic-core/).

Some of the technologies we trust: _NodeJS, ReactJS, MySQL_
